[IsWhen.info][iswhen] (as in, "[Thanksgiving is **when**?][thanksgiving]") is a
simple site I put together because I could never keep track of when different
irregularly recurring holidays occur. And even regular holidays, I'd have to
look on a calendar to remember which day of the week it was this year.

I mainly tinker with it to keep honing the craft of building web apps and to
experiment with methodologies. It's gone through a number of back-end revisions
(it even started as a PHP app), but remains fairly spare on the front-end, as I
am not a designer by trade or talent.

It also serves the back-end data to my more-or-less experimental [IsWhen iOS
app][ios].
